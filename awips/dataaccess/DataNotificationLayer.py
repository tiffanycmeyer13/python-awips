"""
Interface for the DAF's data notification feature, which allows continuous
retrieval of new data as it is coming into the system.

There are two ways to access this feature:

1. The DataQueue module (ufpy.dataaccess.DataQueue) offers a collection that
automatically fills up with new data as it receives notifications. See that
module for more information.

2. Depending on the type of data you want, use either getGridDataUpdates() or
getGeometryDataUpdates() in this module. Either one will give you back an
object that will retrieve new data for you and will call a function you specify
each time new data is received.

Example code follows. This example prints temperature as observed from KOMA
each time a METAR is received from there.

  from ufpy.dataaccess import DataAccessLayer as DAL
  from ufpy.dataaccess import DataNotificationLayer as DNL

  def process_obs(list_of_data):
      for item in list_of_data:
          print(item.getNumber('temperature'))

  request = DAL.newDataRequest('obs')
  request.setParameters('temperature')
  request.setLocationNames('KOMA')
  
  notifier = DNL.getGeometryDataUpdates(request)
  notifier.subscribe(process_obs)
  # process_obs will called with a list of data each time new data comes in
